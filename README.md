# My-Projects

I am keen on analysing the data with an attention to the details and data complexity. Some of my favorite projects are presented on this page in which I tried to disassemble the problem completely, as well as to improve myself as a specialist in a particular area. This portfolio presents works on such actual fields in Data Science as Supervised and Unsupervised ML Techniques, Natural Language Processing, Cost Optimization Algorithms, Dashboard Data Visualisations, Network Analytics and Data Engineering Pipelines.
